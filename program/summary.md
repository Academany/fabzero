# Official Fab Zero Program Syllabus

> **Warning! Risk of brain memory overflow** :dizzy_face:. Remember, this is **not** a novel. Do **not** attempt to follow these topics from the beginning till the end, one after the other. They are designed to be **mixed-up and spread** over the course. Your mentor will design and adjust an adequate **learning path** for the group.
