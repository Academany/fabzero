# 3D Scanning and Printing

## General Notes

* File limit set to 1 Mb per file. Check file sizes `du -s * | sort -rn` 1-2 Mb week
* Clean up the archive (remove old unused students folders and files)
* Whatever you 3D print, it must be your own design. It cannot be just downloaded. You can modify another's design though, give credits in this case.
* You have to design so that it cannot be made substractively and you have to explain why.

## 3D Printing
* All students: Learn how to level the 3D printer.
* Before printing, I recommend first do the _move material_ in the Maintenance/Advanced menu. Once the nozzle is at printing temperature (around 210C) move the material using the clickwheel until the material comes out of the nozzle steady and without imperfections.

In the image above, you can see the 0.4mm filament through the microscope. To the left you can see symptoms of a partially obtruded nozzle. If this is the case perform an [atomic clean](https://ultimaker.com/en/manuals/149-atomic-method). And the right is a good looking filament.

### Group assignment
* Find out limits of the machine. Print a test: [Thingiverse test prints](http://www.thingiverse.com/search/page:1?q=test&sa=).
* Test speed, increase speed while printing a cylinder until you reach under extrusion.
* Try lowering the temperature every cm while printing a cylinder 210 - 205 - 200 ... until you reach under extrusion.

### Individual assignment 1
* Design **for the machine** and not the opposite
* Design a small object (few cm). It is better to test many small objects and learning from all of them than printing a huge object.
* Host big STL files in sketchab
* Original design file should go in the archive

## 3D Scanning

### Individual assignment 2
Scan something using:

* Camera Pictures
* Xbox Kinect
* Structured light
* Roland Modela (windows). Scan something that you cannot scan with this level of detail (like a coin) or not possible at all like Glass.

### Extra assignments
Since these are not mandatory you can do and document them in group.

* Learn how to edit and fix STL files
* Try to 3D print your scan
* Try make your own scanner DIY (milk scanner, laser scanner, ...)
