# Introduction to Pre Fab Academy. Getting ready

## Before we start: The notebook
For the Pre Academy and also Fab Academy **it is strongly recommended that you always carry with you a notebook** with around 100 non detachable pages that you will use **exclusively** for the course. Do not use separate sheets because it is highly probable that they will eventually end up lost and shuffled. Screenshots are helpful, but do not rely all your research in screenshots only.

Divide your annotations in entries. In every entry you can write:

* Date and time
* What you are doing, for what assignment (you will forget soon)
* Include machines used and settings
* Include workflows, protocols or procedures you are following
* Include troubles you are finding in the way, and how are you dealing with them
* Include a debugging table if you are debugging
* Finish the entry with a conclusion (Finished, to be continued later, stuck in a process, ...)

> Exercise: Get a notebook for the pre academy program and write down your first entry and answer in one sentence: Why are you here? Please, nothing similar to [this](http://cmorse.org/missiongen/)

## What are Fab Labs?

  * Collaboration
  * Standardization
  * Conferences (global, regional)
  * FabLabs.io
  * Fab Foundation
* Academany


### Methodology
Fab Academy is not a traditional but a **distributed education system** with tutors instead of teachers. Students undertake their own research in a 5 months long program. Academany educational programs are based on [the nine principles](http://media.mit.edu/about/principles) from Joi Ito (MIT Media Lab).

* No roads, make your own path
* Free your mind (forget what you already know)
* Be brave, take risks (not physical risks)
* Stress control. Can you handle it?

### How Fab Academy works
* Basic principle is **Learn + make + share**. Based in the Scientific method
* Every week a different topic.
* Learn: Weekly class by Neil Gershenferld (MIT) by videoconferencing system. Student undertakes its own research
* Make: Hands-on with local instructor guidance to complete an assignment. Is an iterative approach strategy where time management is crucial
* Share: Student documents the experience through a personal portfolio
* Student self-assesment: Student checks its progress against the _Assignments and Assestments_ document.
* Local evaluation: Local instructors make sure you meet the required standard
* Global Evaluation: Completing students go through global evaluation process
* Graduation: Diploma vs Learning
* Links to previous years archives and important docs
