## Learning about components

Let's learn a little bit about how the components work. A good resource is the O'Reilly Enciclopedia of Electronic Components[.](files/books.zip) Do you know what are these components for and how do they work?

## Power sources

## Decoupling Capacitor

## Finding the value of a LED Resistor
