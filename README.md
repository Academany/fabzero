It was originally designed to fill knowledge gaps and aimed to prepare students to succeed and improve their experience during [Fab Academy](http://fabacademy.org). Over the years, it has been growing into a multidisciplinar program, where a customized learning path is designed and crafted to the specific needs of the group.
